## Key Differences

### read_mesh.py (Original)
- Simple CSV reader expecting comma-delimited data
- Shows both raw and interpolated data side-by-side
- Basic slider for Z-axis exaggeration
- Incomplete checkbox implementation
- No proper data validation

### read_mesh3.py (Enhanced)
- Custom file format with row/column headers
- Toggle between raw and interpolated views
- Multiple interpolation methods
- Better widget organization
- More features but somewhat cluttered

### read_mesh_np.py (Refined)
- Cleaner, single-plot interface
- Professional appearance with proper titles
- Window state management (maximized)
- Data statistics display
- Better default values (dynamic Z-scale based on data dimensions)
- More polished overall but fewer interpolation options

## Recommendation: Keep read_mesh_np.py

**Reasons:**
1. Most professional appearance
2. Better code organization
3. Includes data statistics
4. Window management features
5. Cleaner UI without sacrificing functionality
6. Dynamic scaling based on data dimensions

**Improvements needed:**
- Add back cubic/quintic interpolation (commented out for performance)
- Add export functionality
- Better error handling
- Option to show raw data plot
- Command-line argument support
